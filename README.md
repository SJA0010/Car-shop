# Car-shop

## Project Description

I am thrilled to share my experience of developing an E-Commerce full stack app for online transactions of national means. Alhumduillah, my client was highly satisfied with my attractive UI and vast knowledge of widgets and packages. My code was smooth and clean with a captivating UI. This was a 3-month-long project, but the wait was worth it. I, along with my team, were engaged in this project. And I'm committed to satisfying my clients in the future with the same spirit. Check out this new E-commerce app for auto parts! With a satisfying response from the client, I converted Figma into Flutter UI to create a seamless shopping experience. This app allows you to easily buy and sell car parts online, with the convenience of online payment and delivery straight to your doorstep. Don't waste time searching for the parts you need - order them through this app today!

## Network Architecture

Below is the network architecture of Paytin:

To display all images in a single row with horizontal scrolling in HTML, you can use a combination of CSS flexbox for the layout and overflow properties to enable the scrolling. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        .image-container {
            display: flex;
            overflow-x: auto;
            white-space: nowrap;
            max-width: 100%; /* Adjust as needed */
        }

        .image-container img {
            margin-right: 5px;
            width: 300px; /* Adjust the width as needed */
        }
    </style>

        <img src="https://github.com/SJA0010/Car-shop/blob/main/IMG-20240707-WA0010.jpg" alt="Network Image 10">
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:

- **HTML Structure**: A container (`div.image-container`) wraps all the images.
- **CSS**:
  - `display: flex;`: Makes the container a flex container.
  - `overflow-x: auto;`: Enables horizontal scrolling if the content exceeds the container's width.
  - `white-space: nowrap;`: Prevents the images from wrapping to the next line.
  - `max-width: 100%;`: Ensures the container doesn't exceed the width of its parent element.
  - `margin-right: 5px;`: Adds some spacing between the images.
  - `width: 300px;`: Sets a fixed width for the images (adjust as needed).

This setup will create a horizontally scrollable row of images that you can scroll through if they exceed the container's width.
