# Car-shop

## Project Description

I am thrilled to share my experience of developing a E-Commerce full stack app for a online transaction of national means . Alhumduillah, my client was highly satisfied with my attractive UI and vast knowledge of widgets and packages. My code was smooth and clean with captivating ui. This was 3 months long project, but the waiting worth it. I along with my team  were engaged in this project. And I'm committed to satisfy my clients in future with same spirit. Check out this new E-commerce app for auto parts! With a satisfying response from the client, I converted Figma into Flutter UI to create a seamless shopping experience. This app allows you to easily buy and sell car parts online, with the convenience of online payment and delivery straight to your doorstep. Don't waste time searching for the parts you need - order them through this app today!
