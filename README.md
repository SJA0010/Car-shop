## Project Description

I am thrilled to share my experience of developing an E-Commerce full stack app for online transactions of national means. Alhumduillah, my client was highly satisfied with my attractive UI and vast knowledge of widgets and packages. My code was smooth and clean with a captivating UI. This was a 3-month-long project, but the wait was worth it. I, along with my team, were engaged in this project. And I'm committed to satisfying my clients in the future with the same spirit. Check out this new E-commerce app for auto parts! With a satisfying response from the client, I converted Figma into Flutter UI to create a seamless shopping experience. This app allows you to easily buy and sell car parts online, with the convenience of online payment and delivery straight to your doorstep. Don't waste time searching for the parts you need - order them through this app today!
